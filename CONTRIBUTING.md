# Contributing

Before contributing or commenting, please keep in mind that I am not a professional in infosec or penetration testing—just a student eager to learn and share knowledge with others. Many contributors here may also be students or beginners, so let’s foster a respectful and supportive environment.

The main goal of this project is to promote **ethical hacking** and to create educational content. Tools that are strictly focused on malicious hacking or offer no practical use for a professional penetration tester will **not** be included in the README.

> **Please do not open issues to request help with tools.**

This space is focused on ethical hacking education. For general discussions, please head over to the *[**#discussions**](https://github.com/sundowndev/hacker-roadmap#discussions)* section in the **README**.

## Submitting a New Tool

Before submitting a tool, make sure it meets the following criteria:

- ✅ The tool has been **tested and verified**.
- ✅ It is **actively maintained** or has an established, supportive community.
- ✅ If you are the creator, ensure the code is **stable** and well-documented.

We’re here to learn together and help others do the same—thanks for contributing!

Thank you for sharing and contributing! :tada:
